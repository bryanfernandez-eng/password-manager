## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- OpenAI API key (for chatbot functionality)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd password-manager
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/password-manager

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here

# Password Encryption
SECRET_KEY_ENCRYPT=your_encryption_key_here

# Email Configuration (for verification)
EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password

# OpenAI API (for chatbot)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîí Security Considerations

- All passwords are encrypted using AES-256-CBC before storage
- User authentication passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- CORS is configured to restrict access to the API
- Email verification prevents unauthorized signups
- Security headers are set using Helmet middleware

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Two-factor authentication
- Password sharing with other users
- Password breach checking against known databases
- Browser extension for auto-fill functionality
- Mobile application version
- Offline access capabilities
- Import/export functionality for passwords
- Password categorization and tagging
